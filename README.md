## How to run server application
In the directory where "checkIT-server.jar" file is located:

### `java -jar checkIT-server.jar`

Server will run on [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)

## How to run client application

You need to install npm (presumably with Node.js) at first. https://nodejs.org/en/ <br />
Then in the /Client directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Then to run APP:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
<br />
Login details for an example user: <br />
Login: karol.krawczyk@pwr.wroc.pl <br />
Password: 12345678<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that for a one account, server authorizes only one valid logged session at the time.
That mean, if you want to test APP in two different browsers, remember to logout from the first one you tried.
